# GUS local model notice

GUS Mobile is an open-source project. Model files remain with their respective
upstream repositories and are downloaded by the user directly to the iPhone;
they are not bundled in the app, IPA, or CI artifacts. Before a model can be
used, the app verifies its pinned file size and SHA-256 digest.

The application pins each artifact's SHA-256 in its reviewed source manifest.
The digest is displayed in the model screen and checked along with exact size
before installation or loading. Model files live under the app's
`Files > On My iPhone > ISyCode Móvil > ISyCode/GUS/Models` folder. Users may
keep more than one approved model and select one at a time.

## GUS behavior and boundaries

All three models use the same GUS role prompt. The selected model changes the
local inference weights only; it does not change GUS instructions or grant
capabilities. GUS currently provides local guidance with tool calls disabled.
The app's permissions and approval flow remain the authority for any future
action. Local inference does not fall back to a remote provider.

Starting a download is an explicit user action. iOS background transfers can
continue while the app is suspended or the screen is locked, and iOS may relaunch
the app for transfer events. Force-quitting from the app switcher cancels the
transfer; reopen the app to see whether it can resume or must restart. Network
conditions and iOS scheduling may also delay completion.

Each model's owners and licensors remain third parties; ISyCode Móvil does not
claim to own, author, endorse, or support Qwen, HuggingFaceTB, or the GGUF
converters/uploaders. Users must follow the license for the specific model they
choose. Qwen outputs are not used to train, fine-tune, distill, or create
training data for another model.

## Inference runtime

The iOS runtime is built from [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)
commit `842b1880415d6f508f03b789e5ce70194def7bfd` under the MIT license (copy:
[docs/licenses/LLAMA_CPP_MIT_LICENSE.txt](licenses/LLAMA_CPP_MIT_LICENSE.txt)).
The app does not launch a CLI or subprocess.
